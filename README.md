# Image-to-ascii-art GUI

This is simple image to ascii art converter that I built.

Sadly, it only supports .jpg and .png files, as of 4.4.2024.

For me, it worked for everything I threw at it, small images
and
even bigger ones look nice, but with the bigger ones be
cautious, cos it will convert it, but it will be impossible
to view, at least in the Windows notepad.

(The code is messy, I know, I wanted to have it done as fast
as I can, to get that good felling from it working and worry
about the look of the code sometimes in the future)
