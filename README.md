# Image-to-ascii-art GUI

This is a simple image to ASCII art converter that I built.

Sadly, it only supports .jpg and .png files. 

For me, it worked on everything I threw at it, small images
and even bigger ones look nice.

(The code is messy, I know, I wanted to have it done as fast
as I can, to get that good felling from it working and worry
about the look of the code sometimes in the future)
